# Data Science Project: Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing


## Project Description

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project I will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected in order to draw a conclusion on the benefit of hand-washing in medical clinics (circa 1846).
